# Gut-microbiota-and-microplastics

These codes and data are for the study "Chronic Poisonâ€”Unraveling Microplastic Effects on Gut Microbiota Across Various Animals Using Machine Learning."

This study utilizes:
- Regression models to explore the impact of driving factors on bacterial diversity and function.
- Classification models to identify the responses of beneficial, harmful, and degrading bacteria (BHD bacteria) under microplastic exposure.

## How to Use These Files:
1. Alpha Diversity:  
   - File: `alpha.csv`  
   - Script: `Regression_alpha.py`  

2. Functional Pathways:  
   - File: `Functional pathways.csv`  
   - Script: `Regression_functional pathways.py`  

3. BHD bacteria:
   - Files: `beneficial bacteria.csv`, `harmful bacteria.csv`, `degrading bacteria.csv`  
   - Script: `classification_BHD bacteria.py`
