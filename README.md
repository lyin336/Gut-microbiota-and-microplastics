# Gut-microbiota-and-microplastics
These codes and data are for the study "Chronic Poisonâ€”Unraveling Microplastic Effects on Gut Microbiota Across Various Animals Using Machine Learning." This study uses regression models to explore the impact of driving factors on bacterial diversity and function, and classification models to identify beneficial, harmful and degrading bacteria under microplastic exposure.
